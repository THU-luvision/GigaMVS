## About

**GigaMVS** is the first gigapixel-image-based 3D reconstruction benchmark for ultra-large-scale scenes. The gigapixel images, with both wide field-of-view and high-resolution details, can clearly observe both the **Palace-scale** scene structure and **Relievo-scale** local details. Owing to the extremely large scale, complex occlusion, and gigapixel-level images, GigaMVS exposes problems that emerge from the poor scalability and efficiency of the existing MVS algorithms. We thoroughly investigate the state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric and textural measurements, which point to the weakness of the existing methods and promising opportunities for future works. We believe that GigaMVS can benefit the community of 3D reconstruction and support the development of novel algorithms balancing robustness, scalability and accuracy.
